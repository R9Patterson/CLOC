# CLOC
 Count Lines of Code via dynamic repo input
 
 Python 3.8.3 must be installed, and the respective CLOC executable. 
 
 This application was created on Windows 10, using the cloc-1.80.exe to execute CLOC.
 
 The .bat file will clone your selected repo, run CLOC, out the calculated CLOC results as a .csv, and then email the results to desired email address.
